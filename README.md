# last-positions

Simple web-app to track positions from your smartphone. It captures a position every 30 seconds, sends it to a webtask that stores positions on Redis and then shows the result on Google Maps.

The app would be more useful if we tracked the last position of multiple users, but it would also be harder to see it working. =)

Requires a browser with ECMA 6 support.
